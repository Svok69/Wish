    <h5>Before everything else, before we ended in no contacts gusto ko munang sabihin na I wish 'di mo nalang akong sinukuan, sana pinaalam mo nalang kung anong nasa isip mo, sana lumaban ka nalang andito naman ako para samahan ka sa laban mo

Sasamahan naman kita eh alam mo naman yon I'll be by your side no matter what diba? I thought nothing could keep us apart, but I was wrong.


How I really wished na sana nagstay ka nalang na sana hanggang ngayon kung ano man yang nilalabanan mo andito ako I wish we'd grown up on the same advice because I believe it was never late to fix everything, sabi mo ako na yung hinahanap mo lang lalaki, ow how I wish that was true, How I wish na I was the man you've been wishing for.


Sabi mo gusto mo'ko maghabol? You are worth chasing naman sinabi ko pero hindi naman tama din yung paghahabol mo yung tao, ako. I really wanted to chase you so bad pero if I'm chasing nothing, nothing will happen din naman ngayon tinatanggap ko na onti-onti na wala na talaga I'll miss everything, lahat ng mga ginawa natin lagi kong sinasabi sayo yan.


Nakakapanghina din na after we broke up you were looking for someone to talk to kahit na andito ako sa'yo kausap nang kausap sa'yo

Listen, hindi ka mahirap mahalin at intindihin I loved everything about you, kaya kong intindihin lahat ng issues mo kaya nga di ako naggive up satin diba? Issue sayo yon, pero never naging issue sakin yon kasi mas malakas yung pagmamahal ko sa'yo


Gusto mo munang mahalin sarili mo? I really don't think na that's a reason to break up with someone you meant to say na you miss being you, you miss being free.


And I just wanted to tell you din na you are not worthless, you are the one reason why I still choose to live everyday, you are the one reason why I'd still choose to fight everyday to keep on, but now you are gone I don't know if I am still living my life.


I'll miss you being in my room, I'll miss being your shoulder to cry on, I'll miss being your partner being you kasangga, I'll miss the before we eat we kiss first, I'll miss arguing with you over nothing, I'll miss your jealousy, I'll miss you anger issues, I'll miss you smile, I'll miss the moment we will lay down in bed together, I'll miss your flaws, I'll miss those time na pinaplano natin yung future natin our weds, life, having kids, I'll miss those eyes, lips, especially you, I'll miss you</h5>
